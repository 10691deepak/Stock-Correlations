# Stock-Correlations

The goal is to take time series data of all stocks trading on the us markets (open, close, volume, etc) plus time series data of any other metrics which could possibly be useful (daily commodity prices, oil prices, foreign stock indexes, and any other data) to create a linear model anf try to predict future stock prices a few days ahead.
